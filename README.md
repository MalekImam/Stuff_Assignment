## Project structure

1. Core.
2. Modules.
3. Shared.

> Starting with **Core** folder, the core folder holds all the logic of the important functions that are related to everything that should be encapsulated and also to the mechanism of the project structure.

> **Modules** folder is the container of all the main components of the project, in another word we can say that modules folder represent the application screens.

> **Shared** folder is the container of everything that can be accessible from the main components, by this way we can create generic components and used them in any main component so it will be easy to use, maintain and debug.
